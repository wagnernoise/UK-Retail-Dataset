# UK Retail Dataset

In this study we will be focused on prediction engineering. Prediction engineering is a step in predictive modeling where we: 
* Define an outome we are interested in predicting 
* Scan the data to find the past occurences of the outcome 
* Make these past occurences training examples for machine learning/modeling

We will then use featuretools to extract features and learn a predictive model. We wil be use a retail dataset openly available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail
We will define the prediction problem as the one where the customer has more than k purchases.

To help us to conclude such task, we will use the package [Feature Tools](https://www.featuretools.com). 
[Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com/) is a framework to perform automated feature engineering. It excels at transforming transactional and relational datasets into feature matrices for machine learning.
